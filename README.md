# Raspberry Pi Stock Scraper and Notifier
---
Python web scraper that checks stock for various Raspberry Pi models from https://rpilocator.com/ and sends device notifications using the [Pushover API](https://pushover.net/api). 

- Python 3.6.10 is recommended
- Use of pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv/virtualenv when running script is recommended too

## Installation
---
Setup your virtual environment for Python 3.6.10. Clone the github repo and download all dependencies using:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create an account with [Pushover](https://pushover.net). You can make a one-time purchase or go on a 30 day trial. View their pricing information [here](https://pushover.net/pricing). 

Log in and create a new application [here](https://pushover.net/apps/build). Fill out the necessary fields (including the icon). After creating it, you should be able to obtain the *API Token/Key*:

You also need your *User Key* which can be found on the Pushover home page:

The environment variables need to be set up to send notifications via the [Pushover API](https://pushover.net/api). So create a .env file in the directory where you cloned the repo, enter these vars and add your token and key respectively (enclosed with ""):
```
API_TOKEN = "your_api_token"
USER_KEY = "your_user_key"
```
